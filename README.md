# Emotion recognition

# Facial Emotion Recognition

This project detects human emotions (Happy, Sad, Surprised) from facial landmarks using a **Random Forest Classifier**.  
It consists of three main scripts: data preparation, model training, and real-time testing.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `prepare_data.py` â€“ Extracts face landmarks from images in `./data/` and saves them into `data.txt`.
- `train_model.py` â€“ Trains a Random Forest classifier on the prepared dataset and saves the model.
- `test_model.py` â€“ Loads the trained model and performs real-time emotion detection via webcam.
- `utils.py` â€“ Contains helper functions (e.g., `get_face_landmarks`) for face landmark extraction.

## ðŸš€ Usage
1. **Prepare Data**
   ```bash
   python prepare_data.py
